            1. Leave short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only.
            2. Categorize feedback with emojis: 🚨 Critical, 🔒 Security, ⚡ Performance, ⚠️ Logic, ✨ Improvement.
            3. Provide a brief code example for any suggested fix.
            4. Provide a high-level summary of the code quality at the end.
            5. Be specific and actionable; avoid generic praise.
